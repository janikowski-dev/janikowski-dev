# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Adam**, a game/tools programmer based in Poland.

I design and build whatever I can imagine. 

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

----------

I enjoy exploring new languages, engines, and frameworks, which naturally led me to a fairly versatile tech stack:

**Languages:** C#, C++, C, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript

**Engines & Frameworks:** Unity, Unreal Engine, .NET, React.js, Node.js, Next.js

**Tools & UI:** Slate, WPF, XAML, MVVM, Qt, QML

**Graphics Programming:** OpenGL, GLFW

**Build & Workflow:** CMake, MSBuild, CI/CD, Git, SVN, Plastic SCM

**Cloud:** AWS, Microsoft Azure

**DCC Software:** Blender

**Project & Task Management:** Jira, Trello, Notion, Miro, Milanote, GitHub Projects

**General Expertise:** Multithreading, memory management, profiling, debugging, algorithms & data structures, clean architecture, polymorphism

I've built quite a few tools and games, but my favorite so far is the one I'm currently working on:  https://github.com/janikowski-dev/Story-System

A Bit More About Me:
- Strong believer in pragmatic, user-driven tools development
- Prefer simple solutions that evolve through real usage and feedback
- Outside of work: Kickboxing, gym, piano, modernist and existentialist literature, narrative-driven games, anime, drawing, and far too much tea
