# Hi, I’m Adam 👋

**Unity Developer (6y, incl. tech lead)** currently focused on **tools programming, editor tooling, and content pipelines**.

## 🔧 What I’m Working On
- Unreal Engine editor tools (asset validation, dependency analysis)
- C# / .NET desktop tools supporting production workflows
- Internal frameworks and shared systems from long-lived Unity projects
- DCC tooling — currently building a **Blender plugin in Python** to support content workflows

## 🧰 Tools & Tech
- **Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine  
- **Languages:** C++, C#  
- **Desktop / UI:** .NET, WPF / XAML  
- **Scripting / DCC:** Python (pipeline & tooling focus)

## ⚡ A Bit More About Me
- Strong believer in **pragmatic, user-driven tools development**
- Prefer simple solutions that evolve through real usage and feedback
- Outside of work: gym, piano, sketching, and far too much tea ☕
