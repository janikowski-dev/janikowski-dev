# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Adam**, a games/tools programmer based in Poland.

I enjoy bringing the cool ideas that pop into my head to life.

If something seems fun or interesting, I’ll usually build it and see it through.

----------

I enjoy exploring new languages, engines, and frameworks, which naturally led me to a fairly versatile skillset:

**Languages:** C#, C++, C, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript

**Engines & Frameworks:** Unity, Unreal Engine, .NET, React.js, Node.js, Next.js

**Tools & UI:** Slate, WPF, XAML, MVVM, Qt, QML

**Graphics Programming:** OpenGL, GLFW

**Build & Workflow:** CMake, MSBuild, CI/CD, Git, SVN, Plastic SCM

**Cloud:** AWS, Microsoft Azure

**DCC Software:** Blender

**Project & Task Management:** Jira, Trello, Notion, Miro, Milanote, GitHub Projects

**General Expertise:** Multithreading, memory management, profiling, debugging, algorithms & data structures, clean architecture, polymorphism

----------

I've built quite a few tools and games, but my favorite so far is the one I'm currently working on:  https://github.com/janikowski-dev/Story-System


----------

A bit more about me:
- Strong believer in pragmatic, user-driven tools development
- Prefer solutions that are efficient, maintainable, and evolve through real usage
- Outside of work: gym, piano, modernist and existentialist literature, narrative-driven games, anime, drawing, and far too much tea
